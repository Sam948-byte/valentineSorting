# valentineSorting

This is a sorting program designed to compare the results of two people from a questionnaire.  In order to use it, put all the names of the people into the ``names.txt`` file.  Then create a file with the same name as the person, and put their results in it, each answer on a new line, without any numbering or labeling.
