# valentineSorting

This is a sorting program designed to compare the results of two people from a questionnaire.  In order to use it, create a file labeled with the name of a person, i.e. ``John Smith.txt``, and put the person's results inside the file.  Put each separate answer on a new line, and ensure that there is no numbering or labeling, solely the answers.
